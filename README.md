In this paper, the predefined-time distributed formation control issue is investigated for a class of multi-agent systems subject to model uncertainties. Firstly, a tunable predefined-time behavioral control scheme is developed by integrating the tunable predefined criterion into the null-space-based behavioral projection mechanism. Each agent combines two prioritized distributed behaviors, ensuring task-space errors converge precisely within the predefined-time bound, while additional parameters allow further tuning of the actual settling time. Furthermore, a tunable predefined-time sliding-mode controller is designed for each agent to track their desired kinematic commands under the influence of uncertainties. The proposed scheme achieves tunable predefined-time formation control for nonlinear multi-agent systems. Unlike traditional behavioral methods, the proposed approach offers decentralized implementation, precise convergence time estimation, and explicit parameter tuning, with convergence time independent of initial conditions. Finally, several simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the closed-loop system are tunable predefined-time bound, revealing the effectiveness of the proposed method.
